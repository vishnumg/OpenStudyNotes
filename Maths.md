## Numbers

* Set of natural numbers, N<sub>0</sub> = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,... }
* Set of Integers, Z = { ..., -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
* Number line: <br> ![Number Line](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Wiki_number_line.png "Number Line")
* Operations:
  * Addition: 
    * Symbol: +
    * Adds a number to another number
  * Subtractions:
    * Symbol: -
    * Reverse of Addition
    * Removes a number from another
  * Multiplication:
    * Symbol: x
    * Repeated addition of one number to itself
    * m * 3 = m + m + m
  * Division:
    * symbol: ÷
    * Distributuin. Reverse of multiplication
    * if 3 x m = n, m = 3 ÷ n
  * Exponentiation:
    * Repeated multiplication
    * denoted as a superscript
    * 2 <sup> 3 </sup> = 3 x 3 x 3
    * reads 2 to the power 3 or 2 raised to three
  * Modulus or Modulo or Reminder:
    * Symbol: %
    * 3 % 2 = 1
    * 5 % 3 = 2
    * 2 % 2 = 0
  * Divides:
    * Symbol: |
    * a | b, reads as "a devides b", means b % a = 0
* Sign rules of Integers:
  * m + -n = m - n
  * -m + n = n - m
  * -m x n = -(n x m)
  * -m x -n = m x n
  * Odd number of negatives multiplies into negative and even number of negatives multiplies into positive
* Prime Numbers: P is a primen number if it has only two factors: 1 and P  itself.
  * P is a prime number if Setr of Factors of P is {1, P}
  * Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ....
  * Sieve of Erasthothenes can be used to fine prime numbers in a range. It is done by picking each unfiltered number and removing its multiples. <br> ![Sieve of Erasthmus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes_animation.gif)
  * Every number can be broken down into prime factors. The process is called prime factorization.
    * 10 = 2 x 5
    * 24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
  *  Prime factors can be used to find GCD(greatest common divisor) of two numbers.
     * Example: ![Finding GCD via prime factorization](https://img.youtube.com/vi/nt0XCgpJQs8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt0XCgpJQs8 "How to find GCF by Prime Factorization")

* 5 ÷ 3 cannot be represented as an integer.Hence, fractions. It can be represented as 1$\frac{2}{3}$ 
* **Rational numbers** are results of p/q where both p and q are integersand q ≠ 0.
  * p is the numerator and q is the denomenator.
* Rational numbers are denoted by Q
* ![Rational Numbers](https://i.imgur.com/kQzJxzk.png)
* Infinite rational numbers between any two numbers.
* All integers are rational
* Not all numbers are rational. For example, $\sqrt{2}$. Hence a larger set called Real Numbers exists.

* ### Quick Notes:
  * Natural Numbers, N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ,4, 5, ...}
  * Integers, Z = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
  * Rational Numbers, Q = {..., -3, ..., -2$\frac{2}{3}$, ..., -1$\frac{2}{3}$, -1$\frac{1}{3}$...,  0, ..., $\frac{1}{2}$, ..., $\frac{4}{5}$, ..., 1, ... }
